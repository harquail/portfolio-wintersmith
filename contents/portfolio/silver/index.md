> Slowly, silently, now the moon  
> Walks the night in her silver shoon;  
> This way, and that, she peers, and sees  
> Silver fruit upon silver trees;  
> One by one the casements catch  
> Her beams beneath the silvery thatch;  
> Couched in his kennel, like a log,  
> With paws of silver sleeps the dog;  
> From their shadowy cote the white breasts peep  
> Of doves in a silver-feathered sleep;  
> A harvest mouse goes scampering by,  
> With silver claws and a silver eye;  
> And moveless fish in the water gleam,  
> By silver reeds in a silver stream.
