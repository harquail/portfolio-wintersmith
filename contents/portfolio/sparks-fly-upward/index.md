> Call now, is there anyone who will answer you?  
>Unto which of the holy ones will you turn?  
>For anger slays the foolish man, and jealousy kills the simple.  
>I have seen the foolish taking root and I cursed his 'bode immediately.  
>His sons are far from safety â€”
>They are even oppressed in the gate, and there is no deliverer.     
>His harvest the hungry devour and take it to a place of thorns,   
>And the schemer is eager for their wealth.    
>For affliction does not come from the dust, nor does trouble sprout from the ground.  
>For man is born for trouble as the sparks fly upward
