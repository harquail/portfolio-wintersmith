> I placed a jar in Tennessee,  
> And round it was, upon a hill.  
> It made the slovenly wilderness     
> Surround that hill.  
>   
> The wilderness rose up to it,  
> And sprawled around, no longer wild.     
> The jar was round upon the ground     
> And tall and of a port in air.  
>   
> It took dominion everywhere.    
> The jar was gray and bare.  
> It did not give of bird or bush,   
> Like nothing else in Tennessee
