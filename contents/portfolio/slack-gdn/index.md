A [Slack](https://slack.com/) integration (slash command) for [The Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/)'s content API.  Remembers recently-posted articles, so it does not repeat itself.  Source code on [github](https://github.com/harquail/slack-gdn).

## Usage

/gdn [search term] [optionally, number of articles]

Run using node.js â€” requires setting "GUARDIAN_KEY" to a [Guardian API key](http://open-platform.theguardian.com/access/) in environment variables.

Helpful button to deploy:

Information on adding commands to Slack [here](https://api.slack.com/slash-commands).

## Limitations

Currently limited to posting 5 articles at a time (larger requests will send 5), because Slack integrations can only post 5 times per invocation.
