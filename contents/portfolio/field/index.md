Field is a prototype iOS app that helps users create looping, musical videos through a remixing algorithm that layers sounds in rhythmic patterns. Created with [Andrew Alburn](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/andrew-alburn/54/157/a9) and [Jadie Oh](http://www.jadieoh.com/) at [Viacom Lab](http://www.viacomlab.com).

Filter signal:

Detect peaks:

Find loud and quiet regions:

Combine peaks + loud regions to find sample regions:

Randomly sample from within sample regions, choosing short clips that are either within the loud regions or aligned with peaks.

Finally, layer the samples in beat patterns, randomly selecting from a set of manually-curated rhythms designed to combine musically:
