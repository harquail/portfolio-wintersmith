We built an app to showcase Yieldmo's v4.0 [iOS SDK](/portfolio/ym-ios-sdk/). 

Available in the App Store and on Github soon.

---

Due to resource constraints, we designed the interaction and UI ourselves, taking cues from the [Ad Builder](https://adbuilder.yieldmo.com/) tool.  Our iOS product was validated by Yieldmo's design team, and used as the template for the Android app as well.
