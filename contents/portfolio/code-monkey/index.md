lyrics:  
>Code Monkey get up get coffee   
>Code Monkey go to job   
>Code Monkey have boring meeting   
>With boring manager Rob   
>Rob say Code Monkey very diligent   
>But his output stink   
>His code not "functional" or "elegant"   
>What do Code Monkey think?   
>Code Monkey think maybe manager want to write god damned login page himself   
>Code Monkey not say it out loud   
>Code Monkey not crazy, just proud   
>Code Monkey like Fritos   
>Code Monkey like Tab and Mountain Dew   
>Code Monkey very simple man   
>With big warm fuzzy secret heart:   
>Code Monkey like you(2X)   
>Code Monkey hang around at front desk   
>Tell you sweater look nice   
>Code Monkey offer buy you soda   
>Bring you cup, bring you ice   
>You say no thank you for the soda cause   
>Soda make you fat   
>Anyway you busy with the telephone   
>No time for chat   
>Code Monkey have long walk back to cubicle he sit down pretend to work   
>Code Monkey not thinking so straight   
>Code Monkey not feeling so great   
>Code Monkey like Fritos   
>Code Monkey like Tab and Mountain Dew   
>Code Monkey very simple man   
>With big warm fuzzy secret heart:   
>Code Monkey like you   
>Code Monkey like you a lot   
>Code Monkey have every reason   
>To get out this place   
>Code Monkey just keep on working   
>See your soft pretty face   
>Much rather wake up, eat a coffee cake   
>Take bath, take nap   
>This job "fulfilling in creative way"   
>Such a load of crap   
>Code Monkey think someday he have everything even pretty girl like you   
>Code Monkey just waiting for now   
>Code Monkey say someday, somehow   
>Code Monkey like Fritos   
>Code Monkey like Tab and Mountain Dew   
>Code Monkey very simple man   
>With big warm fuzzy secret heart:   
>Code Monkey like you(2X)
