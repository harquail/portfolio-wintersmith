During [Yieldmo](https://yieldmo.com)'s annual hackathon, we built an ad product on top of Google's [AMP](https://www.ampproject.org/) product.  Our team was one of three winners among fifteen teams.

AMP ads are have loading preference on AMP pages, so we achieved a 50% load-time reduction on AMP pages.  Because AMP ads are required to be light on CSS and JavascriptÂ we also saw a 60% size reduction and faster load times even on non-AMP pages.
