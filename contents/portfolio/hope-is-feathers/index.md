> "Hope" is the thing with feathers -  
> That perches in the soul -  
> And sings the tune without the words -  
> And never stops - at all -  
> 
> And sweetest - in the Gale - is heard -  
> And sore must be the storm -  
> That could abash the little Bird  
> That kept so many warm -  
> 
> Iâ€™ve heard it in the chillest land -  
> And on the strangest Sea -  
> Yet - never - in Extremity,  
> It asked a crumb - of me.
