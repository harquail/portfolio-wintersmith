lyrics: 
> I knew our plan was doomed  
> Right from the start.  
> The human body's made of   
> More than just a heart   
   
> And though it seemed   
> We'd be together for eternity   
> That's a long long way away   
> From how it seems to be to me,   

>It isn't right that we should fight   
> About the way we fit together.  
> Just another complication  
> That is standing in our way   
>   
> And you know I love you so   
> And even though we'll make a monster   
> It's a beautiful disaster that's too  
> Terrible to simply throw away. 
> 
> Our arteries are red  
> And our veins remain blue  
> But even so our damaged  
> Blood trickles through  
> 
> It's true that all   
> Our relatives died  
> From the blood that  
> Trickled round their inside  
> 
> And so far we've lived our lives  
> Thinking everything was fine  
> Not thinking of the trouble  
> Borne inside us at the time  
> 
> And now we've come to find the sum  
> Is greater than the parts that make it  
> This hereditary sorrow was  
> Kept quite through the years  
> 
> All the grief and the relief  
> Our parents felt when we were healthy  
> Newborn babies we don't get  
> Because genetics is a science made of tears.
