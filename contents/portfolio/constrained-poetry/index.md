A constrained poem I wrote for [The Stonefence Review](http://www.stonefencereview.com/)'s  Spring 2013 publication.

I admit that, in the night, I stole <br>
Into your room, plucked a <br>
Hair from your pillow and <br>
Sent it —midnight airmail— to a  <br>Lab in Tanzania. I’m sorry, but <br>
I just had to know the sequence of  <br>Your soul.
 <br> <br>They say you <br> Can’t curl your <br> Tongue, but you <br> <br>
Can wiggle your ears; <br> That you hate<br>  Apples, fancy
Goulash <br>Grudgingly;<br> <br>  That you<br> 
Can’t quite believe<br>  That there’s life<br><br>   After death.<br> 
They say: you make<br>  A mean omelette, but<br><br>  That your
Galantines<br>  Chaud-froid<br>  Congeal, every<br><br> Time. You’re<br>  Good<br> 
At<br> <br> 
T <br> A <br> G<br> <br> 
Cause you’ve<br> 
An<br> 
Antelope’s speed (<br> <br> 
That’s your <br> 
Argentinian blood, <br> 
Apparently.)<br> <br> 
And you<br> 
Care so much it<br> 
 Aches:<br> <br> 
About<br>
The starving in<br> 
Africa;<br><br>
About the penguins<br>
Global warming’s<br>
Going to melt;<br><br>
About the<br>
Children on the<br>
Corner selling lemonade;<br><br>
About the scantily-<br> 
Clad models in<br>
The magazines — You’ll<br><br>
Always take<br>
The penultimate <br>
Cookie, leaving<br><br>
The last for me; You’ll <br>
Chase a stranger’s <br>
Gecko all<br><br>
Through town<br> 
To return it<br>
 To his arms.<br><br>
They say evolution’s<br>
Grown your<br>
Third toe<br><br>
A quarter<br>
Cm longer<br>
Than the average —<br><br>
And that’s just<br> 
The first page,<br> 
There’s another<br><br>
Thousand, if you<br>
Care to take a <br>
Gander.<br><br>
