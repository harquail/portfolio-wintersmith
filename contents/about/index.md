# Hello, World
I'm Nook (like the [e-reader](http://nook.com)).

I like to make things at the intersection of technology, product, and design.  I work on [Yieldmo's](http://yieldmo.com/) [mobile web](https://github.com/yieldmo/yieldmo-js-sdk/wiki) platforms.  We strive to make mobile advertising elegant and user-friendly.

Previously, I was at [Viacom Lab](http://www.viacomlab.com/), in a user-centered team that created products & experiences to explore the future of media.  Before that, I was at [Dartmouth College](http://www.dartmouth.edu/), where I earned an M.S. in Computer Science with a Concentration in Digital Arts, and helped establish [DALI](http://dali.dartmouth.edu) — a technology innovation lab.

In my free time, I play the violin and bask in my alarmingly extensive knowledge of the Harry Potter universe.  I'm annoyed by pop-up ads and the death of the subjunctive.
